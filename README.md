# Study of Data Structures and Algorithms

>In this comprehensive Java-based project I explored various fundamental and advanced data structures & algorithms, showcasing implementations, tests, and performance analyses. I worked on this project to solidify my understanding of these core concepts, not just in theory but through hands-on experimentation and analysis.

## Features

- **Data Structures:** My exploration covered a range of data structures, from basic ones like Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues, to more complex structures like Trees (Binary, AVL) and Graphs. Implementing these from scratch allowed me to grasp their inner workings and appreciate their real-world applications.
- **Algorithms:** I implemented and analyzed various algorithms, particularly focusing on sorting (QuickSort, MergeSort, InsertionSort) and searching algorithms (Binary Search), along with graph algorithms like Dijkstra's and A* for pathfinding. This exploration was crucial in understanding the efficiency and utility of each algorithm under different conditions.
- **Performance Analysis:** One of my key goals was to not just implement but also analyze the performance of these algorithms. I utilized Java's performance measurement capabilities to run benchmarks, thereby gaining insights into time complexities and the practical impact of algorithmic choices on execution time.
- **Unit Testing:** Reliability and correctness are paramount in software development. I rigorously tested my implementations with a suite of unit tests, ensuring that each data structure and algorithm performed as expected. The screenshot included in the project directory is a testament to this meticulous testing process.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Practical Understanding:** Beyond theoretical knowledge, implementing these structures and algorithms deepened my understanding of their practical applications, limitations, and efficiency.
- **Problem-Solving Skills:** Tackling the complexities of various algorithms, especially in graph theory and sorting, honed my problem-solving and analytical skills.
- **Performance Optimization:** The performance analysis phase taught me valuable lessons in optimization and efficiency, crucial skills in software development.
